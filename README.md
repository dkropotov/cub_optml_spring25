# CUB Optimization Methods in Machine Learning, Spring 2025

Optimization methods underlie in solution of many problems in computer science. In machine learning, one needs to solve an optimization problem during fitting of some prediction model on data, and efficiency in solving such optimization problems directly influences practical applicability of the correspondent machine learning approaches. This module aims to provide students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills in understanding both classic and recent continuous optimization methods (including optimization of non-convex functions) and important features in application of such methods for solving machine learning and deep learning problems. The module supposes a detailed discussion of practical aspects in implementation and usage of optimization routines. As the result of the module students will be able to choose and customize optimization method with better fit for their applied problems.
